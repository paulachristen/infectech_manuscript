Dear Participant,

 

We invite you to share your valuable insights on epidemic forecasting during the COVID-19 pandemic in this brief 10-minute survey.



Our goal is to bridge the gap between epidemic forecasts and practical decision-making, especially in resource-constrained settings. Your experiences will help us:


	Identify unmet needs related to epidemic forecasting.
	Develop user-friendly tools to evaluate and interpret forecasts for policymakers.




This survey is divided into five sections:

 


	Participant Information: To confirm your eligibility for this research.
	Metrics: To understand what types of epidemic forecasts were most commonly used in public health decision-making.
	Questions: To identify the key policy questions and decisions that epidemic forecasts helped address.
	Evaluation: To learn how epidemic forecasts were evaluated (if at all).
	Barriers: To uncover the main challenges that hindered the use and usefulness of epidemic forecasts for policymakers.




This research is conducted by Imperial College London, UK and the University of Nairobi, Kenya.



To learn more about your participation, please review the Participant Information Sheet. Before you proceed with the survey, we kindly request your online consent to participate in this study, please see below clauses and the consent form.

 


	I confirm that I have read and understood the participant information sheet version 1.2 dated 29/07/2024 for the study titled Bridging the Gap: Enhancing the Evaluation & Interpretation of Epidemic Forecasts for Researchers & Policymakers in Resource-Constrained Settings and have had the opportunity to ask questions which have been answered fully.
	I understand that my participation is voluntary and I am free to withdraw at any time, without giving any reason and without my legal rights nor treatment / healthcare being affected.
	I understand that sections of any of my medical notes may be looked at by responsible individuals from Imperial College London, the NHS Trust or from regulatory authorities where it is relevant to my taking part in this research.
	I give consent for information collected about me to be used to support other research or in the development of a new test by an academic institution or commercial company in the future, including those outside of the United Kingdom (which Imperial has ensured will keep this information secure).
	I understand that data collected from me are a gift donated to Imperial College and that I will not personally benefit financially if this research leads to an invention and/or the successful development of a new test, product or service.
	I consent to take part in Bridging the Gap: Enhancing the Evaluation & Interpretation of Epidemic Forecasts for Researchers & Policymakers in Resource-Constrained Settings.
	I give consent to being contacted about the possibility to take part in other research studies.","Which one organization best represents your primary place of work during the COVID-19 pandemic?
