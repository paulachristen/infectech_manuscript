## ðŸ“Š Workflow

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**
   - All raw CSV survey responses are loaded.
   - Responses are cleaned for missing values, placeholders (e.g. `"Other. Please specify:"`), and merged with a country-to-region dictionary.

2. **Section Completion Flags**
   - Binary indicators are generated for whether respondents completed key survey sections (e.g., Metrics, Questions, Evaluation).
   - These are used to define denominators in descriptive statistics and plotting.

3. **Visualizations**
   - Plots are generated using `ggplot2` with consistent themes and color palettes.
   - Section-specific figures are faceted by income group and exported as publication-quality graphics.

4. **Support Functions**
   - All reusable components (e.g., group label formatting, palette assignment) are in `functions.R`.

## ðŸ›  Requirements

Install the following R packages before running the scripts:

```r
install.packages(c(
  "tidyverse", "here", "readxl", "stringr", "gt",
  "openxlsx", "survival", "survminer", "psych",
  "viridis", "ggtext", "gridExtra", "RColorBrewer", "tidytext"
))
```
